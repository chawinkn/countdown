# Countdown Timer

This is a countdown timer based on my event `(app/components/event.ts)` updated from `tokanoon (past website)`

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the event by modifying `app/components/event.ts` and the image by uploading to `app/public`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
